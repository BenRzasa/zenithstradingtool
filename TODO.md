# Stuff to do

## TO FIX:

### LOW PRIORITY -- All pages: Standardize input rules
 - e.g., no 0, Infinity, NaN values allowed in any input boxes (it fucks up stuff)
### DONE -- Misc: Update formatting, add verbosity, clean up code & css files
### DONE -- First: fix github-pages deployment crashing
### DONE -- Quick Summary
### DONE -- Trade Tool
### DONE -- Main Page layout

## TO ADD (No particular order):

### DONE -- Ore Icons
### DONE -- Trade Tool -> Button to "Remove Ores from Inventory"
### DONE -- Trade Tool -> To Receive table & add ores in it to inv
### DONE -- Values -> Custom AV value setting option - saves locally
### DONE -- Custom Background Image (Main page only)
### DONE -- Date & Amount since last CSV change
### DONE -- Custom Value Setting - Per ore
### DONE -- CSV Loader -- Sort by AV gained

### Misc Page -- Box containing "Useful tips & tricks" - link to another card-style page?
 - List of all emblems with perks

### Rare Finds Tracker - Self explanatory, follow layout of JTT
 - Calculate total AV/NV of rare finds, and AV/NV per ore found
 - Manually entered by the user
 - Arrows to tick up or down the find amounts
 - Must be exportable & importable (simple CSV format [oreName:amount#])
    - Allows the user to start where they left off after a re-deploy
 - This MUST be persistently stored - create another Context file to store the data

### Tentative - SETTINGS PAGE
 - Need ideas here...

### Value Chart Page - background transparency/opacity overlay of some sort
 - Pop-up that the user can have (Maybe just make a settings page at this point...)


### Grind Strats - List some of mine and others' favorite grind strats for various ores
 - Format prettily, include drop-down sections for the strategies, categories to open,
pictures, the ore textures, descriptions of the ores, possible lore, etc.
 - Credit the inventor/contributor of the strat
 - e.g., Protireal grind method information, tips and tricks, and so on


### Graphs?
 - AV/hr of layers, Trade data over time, ores gained/NVs gained over time, etc

### And more coming soon... :]
